/**
 * Authorization vocabulary — scopes, entities, and roles.
 *
 * Sources of truth:
 *   - `ONLINE MEDRESE SİSTEMİ- AUTHURIZATION - UZUN VADE PLAN.md` §3 (scopes)
 *     and §4 (per-entity matrices that the roles below participate in)
 *   - Authorization handoff document §3.1 (single-entity model) and §3.5
 *     (role union)
 *
 * Design decisions captured here:
 *   - **Single `flashcard-deck` entity, not 5 variants.** The deck variant
 *     (private / medrese / kosk / course) is a property of the resource
 *     ({@link ResourceRef.subType}) resolved at request time by the
 *     `RoleResolver` from the deck's row, not a separate matrix entity.
 *   - **`create_flashcard` and `manage_flashcards` are not split per deck
 *     variant.** Same scope, different roles allowed depending on the
 *     deck's subType — the dispatch lives in `RoleResolver.resolveDeckRole`.
 *   - **Roles never appear as Keycloak realm roles** except `SYSTEM_ADMIN`.
 *     Resource-level roles (KOSK_MANAGER, MUDERRIS, ENROLLED, …) are
 *     derived from enrollment/ownership tables by `RoleResolver` at
 *     request time — no JWT `resource_roles` claim, no identity-sync.

/** Single source of truth for the scope union. New scopes are added here
