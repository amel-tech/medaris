   * Decide whether `user` may invoke `scope` on `resource`.
   *
   * Algorithm:
   *   1. Realm-role bypass: if `realm_access.roles` carries
   *      SYSTEM_ADMIN, allow everything.
   *   2. Ask `RoleResolver` for the caller's role on this specific
   *      resource. The resolver does the domain-level work (deck variant
   *      dispatch, enrollment lookup, ownership join). If it returns
   *      `null`, treat the caller as `PUBLIC`.
   *   3. Look the role's scopes up in `MATRIX[entity]`. Allow iff the
   *      requested scope is listed.
   *
   * The matrix is closed by default — anything not explicitly granted
   * is denied.
   *
   * `realm_access.roles` is read defensively: if Keycloak's protocol
   * mapper is misconfigured and the claim arrives as a string instead
   * of an array, the `Array.isArray` guard treats it as empty (no
   * bypass) rather than throwing.
