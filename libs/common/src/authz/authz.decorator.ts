 * The return type is narrowed to `MethodDecorator` deliberately: a
 * controller class typically carries handlers with different scopes,
 * so a single class-level rule is almost never what the author wants.
 * Forcing method placement at compile time prevents the footgun where
 * `@Authz(...)` silently has no effect because it was placed on the
 * class.
 *
 * @example
 *   @Patch('/courses/:id')
 *   @Authz(SCOPES.EDIT, byParam(ENTITIES.COURSE))
 *   updateCourse(...) { ... }
 *
 * @example
 *   // Creating a course is authorized against its parent kosk
 *   @Post('/courses')
 *   @Authz(SCOPES.MANAGE_COURSES, byBody(ENTITIES.KOSK, 'koskId'))
 *   createCourse(...) { ... }
 *
 * @example
 *   // A card endpoint resolves its parent deck via DB lookup
 *   @Patch('/flashcard/cards/:id')
 *   @Authz(SCOPES.MANAGE_FLASHCARDS, async (req, mod) => {
